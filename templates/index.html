<p>We are social workers, lawyers and organizers who are dedicated to filling the cracks in Americaâ€™s social safety net. In a world that is increasingly hostile to people of uncertain immigration status, LGBTQAI peoples, and people of color, it can be hard-to-impossible for many to access the services they need. Our volunteers act as guides through the system for those in search of help.

<h1 class=headline>Where are we</h1>

<p>Our volunteers live in cities around the country. We endeavor to arrange clients to be placed with volunteers in their local area whenever possible. 

<h1 class=headline>Our Mission</h1>

<p>Lightline was formed to serve as a resource to those overwhelmed by or without access to traditional sources of legal and social support.
